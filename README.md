# **Microservices Repository**

Welcome to the **Micro Services Repository**! This repository serves as a scalable foundation for my microservice architecture. Currently, it includes the **IP Upload** microservice, which is designed to handle IP address data ingestion, processing, and integration with third-party APIs.

## **📂 Repository Overview**
```
micro-services/            # Root directory for all microservices
└── ip_upload/             # IP Upload microservice (fully implemented)

# Placeholder for Additional Microservices
└── service-01/
└── service-02/
└── service-03/
└── service-N/
```

#### **Scaling the Architecture**
This repository is built with scalability in mind. As I develop additional microservices, each will reside in its own subdirectory with dedicated setup and usage documentation. I encourage contributions and welcome enhancements to the architecture.
